# Part II of Typescript Assessment

## Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?

 - As Start , Javascript is the language that we mostly use for Client side development and interactions between between nodes(servers) and browsers.
 - Typescript , On top of it provide more static and structured types and interfaces to run the code.
 - So we have the ability to instantly access with datas and provide response in a quicker manner.
 - That is what solana needed for, we need faster interactions, so we use sdks and web apps and libraries one every part client side logic with Typescript.
